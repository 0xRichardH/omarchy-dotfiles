# Plan: Update xremap config to remap Ctrl as Esc

## Requirements
- Remap Left Ctrl to: Esc when pressed alone, Ctrl when held
- Comment out the existing CapsLock mapping (for potential future use with different keyboard)
- User switched to a different keyboard and needs this change

## Current Configuration
File: `xremap/.config/xremap/config.yml`
```yaml
modmap:
  - name: CapsLock as Ctrl/Esc
    remap:
      CapsLock:
        alone: Esc
        held: Ctrl_L
```

## Implementation Plan

### File to Modify
- `xremap/.config/xremap/config.yml`

### Changes
1. Add new modmap entry for Left Ctrl key
   - Name: "Ctrl_L as Ctrl/Esc"
   - Remap: Ctrl_L
     - alone: Esc
     - held: Ctrl_L
2. Comment out the existing CapsLock mapping
   - Prefix each line with `#` to preserve for future use

### Result Structure
```yaml
modmap:
  # - name: CapsLock as Ctrl/Esc
  #   remap:
  #     CapsLock:
  #       alone: Esc
  #       held: Ctrl_L
  - name: Ctrl_L as Ctrl/Esc
    remap:
      Ctrl_L:
        alone: Esc
        held: Ctrl_L
```

## Verification
After applying changes with `stow`:
1. Restart xremap service: `systemctl --user restart xremap`
2. Test Left Ctrl:
   - Press and release quickly → should produce Esc
   - Hold and press another key → should act as Ctrl modifier
3. Verify CapsLock works normally (default behavior)

## Notes
- The commented CapsLock mapping can be uncommented if switching back to the old keyboard
- Only Left Ctrl is affected; Right Ctrl remains unchanged
