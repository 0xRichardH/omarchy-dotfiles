# Plan: Update xremap config to remap Ctrl as Esc

## Understanding
The user wants to update the xremap configuration because they've switched to a different keyboard. Currently, CapsLock is mapped to:
- When pressed alone: Esc
- When held: Ctrl_L

The user wants to change this to use Ctrl instead of CapsLock.

## Current Configuration
File: `xremap/.config/xremap/config.yml`
- Maps CapsLock to Esc (alone) and Ctrl_L (held)

## Investigation Needed
Before finalizing the plan, I need to clarify:
1. Which Ctrl key do you want to use (Left Ctrl, Right Ctrl, or both)?
2. Do you want the same behavior (alone = Esc, held = Ctrl)?
3. Should I remove the CapsLock mapping entirely, or keep it as well?
